Here I have used Kaggle dataset. Used Isolation Forest Algorithm for identifying outliers within few splits, because the sooner the better. A score is given to each leaf node the increases as the depth of tree increases so here my function is path length from root node to leaf. The outliers get separated/detected in the early stages. This algorithm is kind of an extension of Random Forest algorithm. It has less time and space complexity. It is used as it is the most efficient and effective algorithm.
